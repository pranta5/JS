## parts of oop

 Object literal

- Constructor function  :creates and initializes an object.a constructor gets called when an object is created using the new keyword
- prototypes : 
- Classes
- instances(new,this)       this :refer current execution context

## 4 pillars

- Abstraction  : hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object. (fetch)
- Encapsulation : restricting direct access to some of the object's components
- Inheritance   : Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class inherits the properties and methods of an existing class.
- Polymorphism  : It allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon.
